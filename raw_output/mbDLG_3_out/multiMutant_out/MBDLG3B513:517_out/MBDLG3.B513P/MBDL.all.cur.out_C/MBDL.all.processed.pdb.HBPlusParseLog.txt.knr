-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1449, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1472.
   It is 2.07599 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.08
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1472
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1415
