   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1341
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1311
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

Hydrogen acceptor distance    : 1.8

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   OG1, chain B, residue number 515, PDB ID 1401.
4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1400, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1408, is a H, and it is 1.7991
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1408.
   It is 1.7991 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 1.8
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1408
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1391
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
