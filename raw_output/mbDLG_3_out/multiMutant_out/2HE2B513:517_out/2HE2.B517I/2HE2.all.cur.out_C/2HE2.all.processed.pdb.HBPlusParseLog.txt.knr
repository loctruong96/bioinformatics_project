   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1355.
   It is 2.48446 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.48
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1355
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1311
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
