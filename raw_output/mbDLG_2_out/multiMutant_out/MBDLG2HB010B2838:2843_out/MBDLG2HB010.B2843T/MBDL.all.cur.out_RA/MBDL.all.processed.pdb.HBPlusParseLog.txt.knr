1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number -999, PDB ID 1.
4. There are 4 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 2, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 5, is a H, and it is 3.80122
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 6, is a H, and it is 3.97472
   Angstroms from the acceptor.

   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 7.
   However it is 2.43179 Angstroms from the 
   donor, which is further than the 2.41 distance calculated by HBPlus!
Result: HBond Donor Atom was NOT found!
