2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number 77, PDB ID 1104.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1105, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1112, is a H, and it is 2.27965
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1089, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1112.
   It is 2.27965 Angstroms from the donor,
