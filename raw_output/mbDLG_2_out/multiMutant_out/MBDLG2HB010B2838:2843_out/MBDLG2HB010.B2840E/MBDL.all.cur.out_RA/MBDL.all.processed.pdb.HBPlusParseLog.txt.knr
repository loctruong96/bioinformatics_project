1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number -999, PDB ID 1.
4. There are 4 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 2, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 5, is a H, and it is 3.58515
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 6, is a H, and it is 3.78502
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 7, is a H, and it is 2.22696
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 7.
   However it is 2.22696 Angstroms from the 
   donor, which is further than the 2.21 distance calculated by HBPlus!
Result: HBond Donor Atom was NOT found!

-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1123, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1137.
   It is 2.19904 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.2
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1137
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1108
