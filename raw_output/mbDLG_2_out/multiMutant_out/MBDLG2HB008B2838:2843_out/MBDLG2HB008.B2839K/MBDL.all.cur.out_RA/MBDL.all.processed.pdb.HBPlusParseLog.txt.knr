-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   NH1, chain A, residue number 76, PDB ID 1134.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom NH1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1133, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1147, is a H, and it is 2.43867
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1148, is a H, and it is 2.89536
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1147.
   It is 2.43867 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.44
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1147
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1422
