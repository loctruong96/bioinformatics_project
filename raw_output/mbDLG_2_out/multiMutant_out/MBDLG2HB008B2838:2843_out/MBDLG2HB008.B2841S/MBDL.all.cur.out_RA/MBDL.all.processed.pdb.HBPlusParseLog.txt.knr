The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number 76, PDB ID 1127.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1128, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1138, is a H, and it is 2.29699
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1114, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1138.
   It is 2.29699 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.3
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1138
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1084
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
