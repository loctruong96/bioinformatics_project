Acceptor residue number       : 74
Hydrogen acceptor distance    : 2.3

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number 77, PDB ID 1151.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1152, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1159, is a H, and it is 2.29592
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1136, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1159.
   It is 2.29592 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.3
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1159
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1098
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1180, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1184, is a H, and it is 1.99837
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1170, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor
