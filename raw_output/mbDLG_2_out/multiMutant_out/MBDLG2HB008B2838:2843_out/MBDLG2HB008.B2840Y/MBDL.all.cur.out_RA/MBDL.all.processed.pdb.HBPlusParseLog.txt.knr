   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1184.
   It is 2.13211 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.13
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1184
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1155
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   OG1, chain B, residue number 2841, PDB ID 1408.
4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1407, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1415, is a H, and it is 2.21728
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1415.
   It is 2.21728 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.22
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1415
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1395
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
