4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1028, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1032, is a H, and it is 2.47763
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1016, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1032.
   It is 2.47763 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.48
