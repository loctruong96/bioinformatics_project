6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1273.
   It is 2.39975 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.4
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1273
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1237
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
