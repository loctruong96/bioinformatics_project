# KINARI Residue Cluster file for PDB 
# A cluster is defined as: 
#  [ChainId, startResSeq, endResSeq] [ChainId, startResSeq, endResSeq] ...
# Converting to residue-level clusters: KINARI employs an all-atom model
#  to determine rigid clusters of atoms, and not residues.  This file 
#  contains information only on the backbone rigidity.  Each 
#  residue-level cluster correspondes to an atom-level cluster.  Each 
#  cluster is composed of the resseq IDs of the CA atoms for which the 
#  C-CA and CA-N bonds do not correspond to a hinge in the body-bar-hinge 
#  model, meaning that the rotation is inhibited by the network of 
#  chemical constraints.</p>
