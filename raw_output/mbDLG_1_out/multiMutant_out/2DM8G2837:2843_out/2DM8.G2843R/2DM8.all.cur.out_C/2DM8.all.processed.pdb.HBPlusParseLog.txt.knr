Acceptor residue number       : 102
Hydrogen acceptor distance    : 1.94

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number 104, PDB ID 1381.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1382, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1386, is a H, and it is 1.94053
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1373, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1386.
   It is 1.94053 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 1.94
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1386
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1359
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1393, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1400, is a H, and it is 1.69802
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1400.
   It is 1.69802 Angstroms from the donor,

Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1400
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1396
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
