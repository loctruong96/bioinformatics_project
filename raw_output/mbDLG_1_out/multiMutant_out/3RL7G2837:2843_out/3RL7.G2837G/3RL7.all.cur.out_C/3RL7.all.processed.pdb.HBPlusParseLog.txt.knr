6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1130.
   It is 1.94378 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 1.94
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1130
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1075
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
