-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1142, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1150, is a H, and it is 2.2305
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1128, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1150.
   It is 2.2305 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.23
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1150
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1087
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
