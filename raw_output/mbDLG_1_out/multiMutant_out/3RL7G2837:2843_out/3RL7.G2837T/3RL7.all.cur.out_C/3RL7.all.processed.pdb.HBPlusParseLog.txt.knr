   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1070.
   However it is 1.84655 Angstroms from the 
   donor, which is further than the 1.63 distance calculated by HBPlus!
Result: HBond Donor Atom was NOT found!
