   which is less than or equal to the 2.25
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1183
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1116
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   NH1, chain A, residue number 304, PDB ID 1248.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom NH1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1247, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1261, is a H, and it is 2.44755
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1262, is a H, and it is 3.16351
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1261.
   It is 2.44755 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.45
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1261
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1291
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1369, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1376, is a H, and it is 1.64822
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor
