-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1262, is a H, and it is 3.24115
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1261.
   It is 2.2618 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.26
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1261
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1291
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   OG, chain G, residue number 2837, PDB ID 1370.
4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1369, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1376, is a H, and it is 1.88693
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1376.
   It is 1.88693 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 1.89
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1376
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1372
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
