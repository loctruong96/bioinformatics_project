4. There are 4 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom NZ.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1054, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1068, is a H, and it is 2.56305
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1069, is a H, and it is 3.34797
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1070, is a H, and it is 1.81336
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1070.
   However it is 1.81336 Angstroms from the 
   donor, which is further than the 1.6 distance calculated by HBPlus!
Result: HBond Donor Atom was NOT found!
        NOT adding the above .hb2 line into the list of H Bonds.
