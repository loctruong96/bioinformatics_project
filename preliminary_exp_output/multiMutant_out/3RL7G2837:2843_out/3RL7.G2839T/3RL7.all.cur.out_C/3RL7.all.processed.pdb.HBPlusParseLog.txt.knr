The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   NH1, chain A, residue number 304, PDB ID 1248.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom NH1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1247, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1261, is a H, and it is 2.04891
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1262, is a H, and it is 3.06133
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1261.
   It is 2.04891 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.05
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1261
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1291

5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1322, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1330, is a H, and it is 1.61289
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1310, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1330.
   It is 1.61289 Angstroms from the donor,
