Output from multiMutant resides here. Note, 2DM8 is the ligand short hand I made for ease of coding, G is the chain, 2837:2843 is the start and end residues. Start and end residue is the same for all pbd files.

Filip notes Analysis will involve the EM log file(s) and at minimum the following two rigidity analysis files:
*.pdb_postPG_MetricsBBH.txt, *.pdb_MetricsPDB.txt

Rigidity analysis files can be found at directory for each output folder like EXAMPLE below.
1CRNA3:7_out/1CRN.A3A/1CRN.A.ra.out_RA/1CRN.A.processed.pdb/user/ 1CRN.A.processed.pdb_postPG_MetricsBBH.txt
