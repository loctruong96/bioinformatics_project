The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain G, residue number 2837, PDB ID 1.
4. There are 1 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 2, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. There was not a single Hydrogen atom that is 
   covalently bonded to the donor.
Result: HBond Donor Atom was NOT found!
        NOT adding the above .hb2 line into the list of H Bonds.
