The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain G, residue number 2840, PDB ID 46.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 47, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 53, is a H, and it is 2.0235
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 38, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 53.
   It is 2.0235 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.02
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 53
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 36
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
