The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number 89, PDB ID 1110.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1111, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1121, is a H, and it is 2.47597
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1097, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1121.
   It is 2.47597 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.48
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1121
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1073
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
