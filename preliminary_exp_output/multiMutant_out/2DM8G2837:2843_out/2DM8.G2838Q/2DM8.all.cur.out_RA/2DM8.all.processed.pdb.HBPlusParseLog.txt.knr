1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number 88, PDB ID 1091.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1092, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1099, is a H, and it is 2.15207
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1084, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1099.
   It is 2.15207 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.15
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1099
