-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number 77, PDB ID 1075.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1076, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1086, is a H, and it is 2.49633
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1062, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1086.
   It is 2.49633 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.5
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1086
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1017
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
