-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1172, is a H, and it is 3.81384
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1162, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1171.
   However it is 2.25058 Angstroms from the 
   donor, which is further than the 2.24 distance calculated by HBPlus!
Result: HBond Donor Atom was NOT found!
        NOT adding the above .hb2 line into the list of H Bonds.
