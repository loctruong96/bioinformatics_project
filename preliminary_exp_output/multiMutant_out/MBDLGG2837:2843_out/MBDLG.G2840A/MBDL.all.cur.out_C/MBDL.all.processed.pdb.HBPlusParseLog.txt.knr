-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain A, residue number 78, PDB ID 1099.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1100, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1108, is a H, and it is 2.42726
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1084, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1108.
