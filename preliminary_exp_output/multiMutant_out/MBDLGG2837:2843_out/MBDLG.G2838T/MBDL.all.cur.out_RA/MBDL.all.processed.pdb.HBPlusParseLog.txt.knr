Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1031
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

Hydrogen acceptor distance    : 2.28

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   ND2, chain A, residue number 83, PDB ID 1164.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom ND2.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1171, is a H, and it is 2.2998
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1172, is a H, and it is 3.85195
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1162, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1171.
   However it is 2.2998 Angstroms from the 
   donor, which is further than the 2.28 distance calculated by HBPlus!
Result: HBond Donor Atom was NOT found!
        NOT adding the above .hb2 line into the list of H Bonds.
