Hydrogen acceptor distance    : 2.5

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain G, residue number 2841, PDB ID 65.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 66, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 72, is a H, and it is 2.49922
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 56, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 72.
   It is 2.49922 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.5
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 72
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 39
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   OG1, chain G, residue number 2841, PDB ID 68.
4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 67, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 75, is a H, and it is 1.95159
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 75.
   It is 1.95159 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 1.95
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 75
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 39
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
