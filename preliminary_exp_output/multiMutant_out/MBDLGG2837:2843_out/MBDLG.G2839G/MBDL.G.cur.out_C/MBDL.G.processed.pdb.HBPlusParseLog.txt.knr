Acceptor residue number       : 2839
Hydrogen acceptor distance    : 2.42

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain G, residue number 2841, PDB ID 55.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 56, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 62, is a H, and it is 2.42286
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 44, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 62.
   It is 2.42286 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.42
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 62
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 35
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   OG1, chain G, residue number 2841, PDB ID 58.
4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 57, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 65, is a H, and it is 2.00992
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 65.
   It is 2.00992 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.01
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 65
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 35
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
