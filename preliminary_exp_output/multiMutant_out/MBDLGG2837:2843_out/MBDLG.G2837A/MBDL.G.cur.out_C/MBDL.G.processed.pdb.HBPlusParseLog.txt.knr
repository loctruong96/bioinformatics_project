The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain G, residue number 2841, PDB ID 66.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 67, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 73, is a H, and it is 2.43161
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 55, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 73.
   It is 2.43161 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.43
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 73
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 38
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 68, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 76, is a H, and it is 2.12419
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 76.
   It is 2.12419 Angstroms from the donor,
