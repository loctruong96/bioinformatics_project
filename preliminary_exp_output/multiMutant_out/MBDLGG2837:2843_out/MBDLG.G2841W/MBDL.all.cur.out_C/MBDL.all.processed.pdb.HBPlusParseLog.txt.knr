   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1108
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1031
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   ND2, chain A, residue number 83, PDB ID 1164.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom ND2.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1171, is a H, and it is 2.26267
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1172, is a H, and it is 3.83036
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1162, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1171.
   It is 2.26267 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.26
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1171
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1126
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain G, residue number 2841, PDB ID 1265.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1266, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1279, is a H, and it is 2.17164
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1254, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor
