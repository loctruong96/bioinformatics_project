The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   N, chain G, residue number 2841, PDB ID 72.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom N.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 73, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 79, is a H, and it is 2.37112
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 61, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 79.
   It is 2.37112 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.37
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 79
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 45
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 74, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 82, is a H, and it is 2.26742
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 82.
   It is 2.26742 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.27

Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 82
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 45
