Acceptor residue number       : 80
Hydrogen acceptor distance    : 2.19

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   ND2, chain A, residue number 83, PDB ID 1164.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom ND2.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1171, is a H, and it is 2.20078
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1172, is a H, and it is 3.74618
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1162, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1171.
   However it is 2.20078 Angstroms from the 
   donor, which is further than the 2.19 distance calculated by HBPlus!
Result: HBond Donor Atom was NOT found!
        NOT adding the above .hb2 line into the list of H Bonds.

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   OG1, chain G, residue number 2841, PDB ID 1268.
4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1267, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1275, is a H, and it is 2.36778
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1275.
   It is 2.36778 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.37
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1275
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1237
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
