-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1084, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1108.
   It is 2.33453 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.33
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1108
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1031
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   NH1, chain A, residue number 77, PDB ID 1082.
4. There are 3 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom NH1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1081, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1095, is a H, and it is 1.96158
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1096, is a H, and it is 3.28414
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1095.
   It is 1.96158 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 1.96
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1095
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1272
