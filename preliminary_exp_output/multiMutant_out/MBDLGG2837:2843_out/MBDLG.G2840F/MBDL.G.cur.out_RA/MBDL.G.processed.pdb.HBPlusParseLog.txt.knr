Acceptor residue number       : 2837
Hydrogen acceptor distance    : 1.7

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   OG, chain G, residue number 2837, PDB ID 4.
4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 3, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 10, is a H, and it is 1.70195
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 10.
   It is 1.70195 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 1.7
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 10
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 6
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   OG1, chain G, residue number 2841, PDB ID 74.
4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG1.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 73, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 81, is a H, and it is 2.1546
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 81.
   It is 2.1546 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 2.15
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 81
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 39
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
