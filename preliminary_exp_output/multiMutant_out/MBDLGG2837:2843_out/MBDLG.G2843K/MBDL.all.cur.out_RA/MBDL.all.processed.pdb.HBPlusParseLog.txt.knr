   which is less than or equal to the 2.28
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1108
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1031
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.

The following is how the .hb2 line was processed:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Hydrogen acceptor distance is not -1.
2. Neither donor nor acceptor are HOH molecules.
3. Looking for the hydrogen attached to donor atom 
   OG, chain A, residue number 85, PDB ID 1191.
4. There are 2 atoms that are covalently bonded to atom OG.
5. Checking each of them: 
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1190, is a C, so it cannot be the donor H.
-  Covalently bonded PDB atom 1197, is a H, and it is 1.8159
   Angstroms from the acceptor.
6. The Hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to the donor 
   and which is the closest hydrogen candidate is PDB atom 1197.
   It is 1.8159 Angstroms from the donor, 
   which is less than or equal to the 1.82
   distance calculated by HBPlus.
Result: The calculated Donor PDB atom number is    : 1197
Result: The calculated Acceptor PDB atom number is : 1193
Done: Adding hBond to list of found bonds.
